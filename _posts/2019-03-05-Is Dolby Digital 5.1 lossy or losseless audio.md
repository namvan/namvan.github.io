Question: In MakeMKV, I have the option to choose either DTS-HD audio (which is losseless) or DD 5.1. Now I would assume DD is losseless as it's the only Dolby Digitial version I can choose from, however I'm not sure.

Answer: Both Dolby Digital and DTS are lossy formats. DTS' lossless version is DTS HD Master Audio and Dolby's lossless version is called Dolby TrueHD.

Detail answer:
For Blu-ray, DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD are lossless formats. Some older titles also might contain a Linear PCM (LPCM) track which is uncompressed digital sound.

Dolby Digital is a lossy format, as is DTS.

All formats are capable of brilliantly great sound: it all depends on the mix. Technically, the lossless formats and LPCM are capable of more than lossy Dolby Digital and DTS but that doesn't mean those lossy formats are complete crap. In fact, the quality they can achieve given how heavily compressed they are is astonishing. I mean think about it, Dolby Digital 5.1 can be encoded at 384kbps and sound truly stunning on 35mm, LaserDiscs, and some DVDs.

DTS is a little bit less efficient: the half bitrate variety at 768kbps isn't awful but it's nowhere near as transparent as the full 1.5mbps version is, and even to some extent as transparent as Dolby Digital at 384kbps can be.

Theatrical DTS was around 882kbps but is in an entirely different codec than the home version. It was/is great save that it puts the LFE into the surround channel (all below 80hz) and the processor sends it to the sub. Thus, theatrical DTS surround channels can only contain frequencies from 80hz to 20khz.

I believe the theatrical Dolby Digital was around 384kbps, a little less, but is actually the same codec used at home, it's just carried differently on film (printed on the film and a CCD camera reads it and sends it to the processor to convert it back into sound). Full range surrounds.
