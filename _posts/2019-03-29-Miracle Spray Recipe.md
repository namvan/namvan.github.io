* Oven: Make a fume-free oven cleaner by combining 1 cup baking soda with 1/4 cup washing soda and 1 tablespoon liquid soap. Add hot water gradually until you have a thick paste. Add a few drops white vinegar, then coat oven surfaces and leave overnight. Wipe off with warm water.
* Range Hoods and Exhaust Fans: A weekly wash with a mild solution keeps range hoods and exhaust fans grease-free. Rinse well afterwards.
